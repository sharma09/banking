            Banking is an industry that handles cash, credit, and other financial transactions. Banks provide a safe place to store extra cash and credit. They offer savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and checking accounts. Banks use these deposits to make loans. These loans include home mortgages, business loans, and car loans.

        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Banking is one of the key drivers of the U.S. economy. Why? It provides the liquidity needed for families and businesses to invest for the future. Bank loans and credit mean families don't have to save up before going to college or buying a house. Companies use loans to start hiring immediately to build for future demand and expansion.

            <b>How It Works</b>
            Banks are a safe place to deposit excess cash. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures them. Banks also pay savers interest rates or a small percent of the deposit.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
            Banks can turn every one of those saved dollars into $10. They are only required to keep 10 percent of each deposit on hand. That regulation is called the reserve requirement. Banks lend the other 90 percent out. They make money by charging higher interest rates on their loans than they pay for deposits. 
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">
